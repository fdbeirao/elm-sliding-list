{-| A data type that holds an upper bounded sliding list.

When you create a `SlidingList` you specify the maximum number of items that it can hold.

âš  Keep in mind that zero or negative size lists do not really make sense so the minimum size of a sliding list is 1.

The public interface of module is heavily inspired by the [elm-lang/core/List](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/List) module.

When you create a sliding list, you can `cons` items into it, and it will slide after the maximum size:

    new 2
        |> cons "A"
        |> cons "B"
        |> cons "C"
        |> items
        == [ "C", "B" ]

    [ "A", "B", "C" ]
        |> fromList 2
        |> items
        == [ "B", "C" ]

type SlidingList a

Keep in mind that zero or negative size lists do not really make sense so the minimum size of a sliding list is 1.

-}
new : Int -> SlidingList a
new size =
    fromList size []


{-| Create a new sliding list from an existing list, with the specified maximum size.

Keep in mind that zero or negative size lists do not really make sense so the minimum size of a sliding list is 1.

If the size of the initial list is greater than the maximum size of the sliding list, the sliding list will slide, as expected.

{-| Add an element to the end of the sliding list, dropping elements from the beginning of the list if it exceeds the maximum size of the sliding list.

insert item (SlidingList list size) =
    [ item ]
        |> List.append list

Each element will be treated as if it had been inserted by their order in the incoming list.

-}

{-| Resize this sliding list. If the new size is smaller than the current held number of items in the list, it will slide, as expected.

Keep in mind that zero or negative size lists do not really make sense so the minimum size of a sliding list is 1.

Additionally, if you resize the list to zero or a negative number, it will be cleared.
